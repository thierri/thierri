### Hi there! ü§ì¬†Welcome to **Thierri** Github Profile! Here you will find some of what I am working and studying on. 

### **Current Stats (updated on Oct/2022):**

**What I am studying‚Ä¶**

- Consumer-Driven Contracts - CDC.  On a very distributed system, with a huge number of microservices, testing is a challenge. I mean, there is a bunch of dependencies with other. If you have to test everything together, on the integrated test phase, you will miss a big point on having a distributed system, that is the autonomy on the deploy of each microservice. With CDC, you have some alternatives to the integrated testing phase. I am studying this pattern and checking if it can fit on Ita√∫.
- Laravel - PHP Framework. The laravel ecosystem evolved a lot last year and still evolving. They keep PHP alive and up to date with the last tech. For example, serverless functions for PHP and Laravel. Or InertiaJS that is a library that removes all the complexity of integrating the frontend with Laravel backend. So, I think that is a lot to learn with this intense and active community.

**What I am reading‚Ä¶**

- My last very impacting read was Rework by DHH (the creator of ruby on rails).
- And my current read is Peter Lynch. He is a very known economist. I am reading this, because wealth and stocks is a topic that I am very interested in 2022.
- My next planned read, will be the classic Rich Dad, Poor Dad. This is a book that I read a lot of summaries but never had a chance to really read the entire book.

### I little bit about me:

**What I do:**

I am a 32 year old brazilian guy, with leave on Sao Paulo, Brazil. My 9 to 5 job is on Ita√∫, with is the biggest private bank on Latin America. I am current a software engineering leader, helping the careers of 15 employees.

**What I can help you with:**

I can guide developers and software engineers to achieve their goals. I also can help industries and companies with good architectures choices to accelerate the time to marketing of new features and the efficiency of existing features.

I also have a strong teaching skills and I love transforming ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù concepts in easy lessons. I try to do that on my youtube channel, and I have very positive feedback. Check it out [https://www.youtube.com/empacadoblog](https://www.youtube.com/empacadoblog)
